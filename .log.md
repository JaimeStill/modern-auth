Left off with the understanding that [ASP.NET Core Identity](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authentication/identity?view=aspnetcore-8.0) will not work because it [does not support single sign on and is restricted to a single app / domain](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/how-to-choose-identity-solution?view=aspnetcore-8.0#identity-vs-oidc-server).

Need to look further into leveraging [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OpenIdConnect](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OpenIdConnect) in conjunction with a self-hosted OIDC server (for example, [Keycloak with Docker](https://www.keycloak.org/getting-started/getting-started-docker)) to support local auth during development.
